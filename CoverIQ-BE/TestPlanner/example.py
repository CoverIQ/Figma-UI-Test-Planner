# Note: This code provides the logic for each step. To execute it, you would need:
# 1. A Selenium WebDriver instance initialized (e.g., driver = webdriver.Chrome()).
# 2. Actual URLs and selectors replacing the placeholders.
# 3. A test framework (like pytest or a Cucumber runner) to call these functions in the scenario sequence.
# 4. Proper test setup and teardown.
